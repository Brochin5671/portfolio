        include: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, HTML/CSS, GraphQL, SQL, MongoDB,
        Express, Node and Docker. I also have experience with Python, C and Java

        My favorite hobby is Astrophotography🪐, after seeing Saturn in my
        eyepiece and wanting to share the experience with others. Below are
        images taken with my 8" telescope and a dedicated astrocam. Really
        beautiful what sights reside in the night-sky!
